# Introduction

If you create or want to create tools like Ciphey, Autorecon, Sherlock, and more this is the section for you.

If you try to build a large project using only what I taught you in the basics, you will fail. Mainly because:

* Your code will become unmaintainable and thus you will lose all motivation
* Your code will be incredibly slow due to not understanding algorithms / data structures

This section aims to teach you the advance stuff.
