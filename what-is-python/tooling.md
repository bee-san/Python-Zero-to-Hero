# Tooling

Before we begin writing Python code, let's get the tooling right.

Here we'll install Python and a text editor / IDE.

Check if you have Python installed already with:

```text
python --version
```

If this number is below 3, try:

```text
python3 --version
```

* If `python3` works, whenever I say `python` type `python3` instead.
* If neither of these worked and presented a version higher than 3 then:

Install the latest release of Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Note that on Windows, this website defaults to 32-bit Python. Please install 64-bit Python, tool developers will thank you.

Now, let's install a text editor or IDE. I would suggest an IDE, but they are rather heavy on resources.

An IDE will show you errors before you run the code, and will help you to automatically fix those errors.

The best Python IDE is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

However, if your computer has limited resources you may want to use a text editor. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can use Atom or Sublime.

Honestly if you're not going to use PyCharm the choice of text editor at this stage doesn't matter too much. In the wise words of someone I once knew:

> Deciding on the tooling is another form of procrastination. Choose something and get it over with.

Download Visual Studio Code if PyCharm didn't work.
