# Intrepreted

Python is an interpreted language. That means that instead of translating the whole code into machine code at once, it translates the code piece by piece. And once it's converted a piece of code, it runs it, and then continues until the program stops running.

Here's the major differences between compiling and interpreting.

| Compiler | Interpreter |
| :--- | :--- |
| Returns compiled executable. | Returns the result of the program once ran. |
| Runs once, no need to run again unless program changes. | Runs again and again even if the program doesn't change. |
| You don't need the original code are compilation. | You need the original code to run the program everytime. |

So, what are the advantages to intrepreted code vs compiled code?

It's much quicker to run interpreted code, every user you send the code to can run the file. They can verify what the code does before running \(wheres with a compiler, they'll need the original source code or to decompile the program\).

It's also a lot faster to run. If you compile a program and run it, vs run an interpreted program the interpreted program will run faster.

Of course, if you run a compiled executable file and not compile it, it'll be faster. This is because compiled code always tends to be faster than interpreted code.
