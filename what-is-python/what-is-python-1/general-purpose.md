# General Purpose

General Purpose means that Python was created to do everything. Some programming languages like Matlab or R were created for data science. Others like HTML / CSS were created for web development.

Python aims to do everything, it is generalised. This is both a fault and an advantage. You can do everything you want in Python, but it does not have one area where it shines.
