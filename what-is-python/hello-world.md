# Hello, World!

It is very traditional for every programmer, when starting out, to start with a hello world program.

Create a new file called `[hello.py](<http://hello.py>)` and open it up in your text editor of choice \(the one you downloaded in the last section\).

In this new file, copy and paste this line:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Let's explain what this does:

* Print

Print is a function. We give it some text and it'll print it to the screen.

* "Hello, World!"

Is what we call a string \(a string of characters\). It's just text.

Now, open up a Terminal, navigate to your directory and run:

```text
python hello.py
```

And you'll see on your screen printed:

```text
$ Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You have just run your first Python program! ðŸ¥³
